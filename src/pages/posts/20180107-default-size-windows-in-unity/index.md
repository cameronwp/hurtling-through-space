I like to place my terminals on the left and right edges of my screen. Up to like 5 minutes ago, new terminals would open with a y-axis gap between the top of the window and the top of the screen. And they would open at a random x-position. Not any more! I finally [learned](https://www.faqforge.com/linux/tweak-default-size-position-application-window-ubuntu-unity/) about the `--geometry` flag and `.desktop` defaults to control the way applications launch. Very useful! I might go script some keyboard shortcuts to orchestrate sizing multiple windows simultaneously.
