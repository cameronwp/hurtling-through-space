I picked up Murakami's _1Q84_ at LAX before a flight to Australia. It was late and I had had a large beer at the bar in hopes of making sleep come faster at 30,000 feet. I only mention this because there's no other reason for someone to add a 10 pound, 1,200 page book to their already overflowing backpack right before a trip.

The sheer size of the spine of _1Q84_ looks imposing. And then you realize that the pages are thin, phonebook-like paper, which barely give the volume of the book a reasonable appearance.

I want to review the book, but I don't think I can come to a conclusion. Coming to a conclusion necessitates a level of understanding about the book that, upon first read, I don't think I have. I honestly can't tell you what the book is about.

(Spoilers ahead!)

The story opens with two storylines, one about a badass, semi-assassin named Aomame, and the other about Tengo, a math teacher and aspiring fiction author. Both live in Tokyo in 1984. On one level, the story is clearly a love story. The two protagonists meet, fall in love, and probably live happily ever after. On the other hand, Tengo and Aomame don't meet until about page 1,190. Certainly not a traditional love story.

Aomame and Tengo separately and accidentally fall into an alternate reality, which Aomame dubs 1Q84 because,

> A world with a question.
