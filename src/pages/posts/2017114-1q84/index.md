I picked up Haruki Murakami's _1Q84_ in a bookstore at LAX before an overseas flight. It was late and I had had a large beer at the bar in hopes of making sleep come faster at 30,000 feet. I only mention this because there's no other reason for someone to add a 10 pound, 1,200 page book to their already overflowing backpack right before a trip.

The width of the spine of _1Q84_ imposes a sense of _depth_, like this book holds more space than the laws of physics say it should.

I want to review the book, but I don't think I can come to a conclusion. Coming to a conclusion necessitates a level of understanding about the book that, upon first read, I don't think I have. I honestly can't tell you what the book is about.

(Spoilers ahead!)

The story opens with two storylines, one about a badass, gym coach turned assassin named Aomame, and the other about Tengo, a math teacher and aspiring fiction author. Both live in Tokyo in 1984. On one level, the story is clearly a love story. The two protagonists meet, fall in love, and probably live happily ever after. On the other hand, Tengo and Aomame don't meet until about page 1,190. So something else has to happen.

What happens?

Upon learning about a major event involving the police, terrorists and a gunfight that happened two years ago, Aomame decides that she has left her normal 1984 behind for a different world, which she dubs 1Q84.

Tengo is introduced to a strange young female author, who has written a story and with whom he agrees to ghostwrite the story into a publishable novel.

And...

...I would go on, but to be honest, the story takes a backseat to Murakami's writing. The story is provacative, exciting, and confusing, but I remember _1Q84_ for the way the words calmly tease you winding through the maybe-real-maybe-make-believe reality. The Tokyo of _1Q84_ twists and blends Impressionism countrysides with acid trip whirlwinds. Debris and hallucinations overwhelm the senses. But the words are clear. You calmly walk, head and eyes forward.

You can tell the author had fun. The book hints at (and eventually reveals) the mystery behind the "world without a name" <>is this a real quote?<>, but Murakami takes his time. He teases us. As the mystery deepens, he feints at one answer and then another and another. He circles us in the ring, telegraphing punches only because he knows our anticipation sets up bigger punches later.

> A world with a question.
