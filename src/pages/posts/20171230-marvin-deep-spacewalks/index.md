<><>start off with an image of an astronaut<><>

Human beings in spacesuits outside of spacecraft have taken some of the most remarkable pictures of the space age.

<><>insert more images of astronauts<><>

Spacewalks fall under a broad mission category known as extravehicular activity (EVA).

Astronauts perform spacewalks routinely, but they're anything but routine. Crew members leave the spacecraft only when necesssary, such as for hardware installations, repairs, and, during the Apollo missions, exploration.

Every astronaut on EVA faces hightened risk. They rely on localized life support systems, which provide limited consumable resources like oxygen and battery power. They face direct exposure to space, an already hostile environment even before considering the possibility of hardware malfunctions, micrometeroid impacts, sudden solar flares, and a million other incapacitating events. In the event of emergency, crew members must react quickly and precisely to stave off disaster. In fact, over the nearly sixty year history of EVAs, about 30%<><>cite with matthew's thesis<><> of EVAs have xperienced some kind of incapacitating event that led to early ingress (coming back into the spacecraft, as opposed to 'egress,' when a crew member exits the spacecraft).

Given the risk inherent to EVAs as well as the generally complexity of EVA tasks, each EVA is a highly choreographed event, sometimes years in the making. As an extreme example, the alpha magnetic spectrometer (AMS), an external piece of hardware onboard the International Space Station (ISS), currently needs repair (I believe a valve needs to be repaired, and it's unfortunately tucked deep within a nasty nest of sharp surfaces in an awkward location). NASA built a full-scale replica of the AMS for use underwater at the Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL, basically a massive swimming pool for weightlessness training) and astronauts will be training for at least two years for the mission.<><>cite if possible<><> During this mission and every other EVA, crew members will be / are in constant, direct contact with personnel<>sp?<> in Mission Control Center (MCC) at Johnson Space Center in Houston. In fact, mission operations at MCC will effectively call every shot. They will keep track of the mission timeline, task status, and suit telemetry (data describing the state of the spacesuit), and they will control most assets like the Canadarm 2 as well. The astronauts themselves are almost robots (or actresses following a script with little opportunity for ad libbing).

The few people at risk in space benefit from dozens (maybe hundreds) of experts on the ground analyzing, predicting, and optimizing for mission success. In low Earth orbit (LEO), cis-lunar space (between Earth and the Moon) or on lunar EVAs keeping MCC in the loop for all decision making is a viable operations paradigm because the speed of light allows it. ISS is only a few hundred kilometers above the ground, where the communication lag is low enough that space crew and ground personnel could reasonably play online video games. In more official terms, we call the lag one-way latenecy time (OWLT). The OWLT of ISS is only about 100ms.<><>check<><>. The Moon has a OWLT of just over one second (I usually see it approximated to 1.3 seconds). MCC to Moon communications are awkward (think a bad connection on an overseas video conference), but they still enable real-time communication and decision making. Explore targets past the Moon, however, and crew members become increasingly isolated.

Most reasonable asteroid targets are far enough that OWLT is measured in minutes. <><>Mars! The premise of the research<><>
