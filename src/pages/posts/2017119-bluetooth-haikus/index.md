_Turns it off and on_<br>
"Ok, it should connect now."<br>
In hell, the devil laughs.

"Music will fill house!"<br>
"Easier than plugging in!"<br>
Those lying bastards.

I see it active.<br>
Flickering, the icon fades.<br>
`Data Transfer Fail`

Sync, my pretty, sync.<br>
I see the video stream.<br>
Oh no. Buffering.

There is connection.<br>
No wait, it has disappeared.<br>
Was it ever there?

Heisenconnection:<br>
The icon shows active sync,<br>
but it is lying.

"Bluetooth enabled,<br>
works with all of your gadgets."<br>
_switches bluetooth off_

_The time zone is wrong..._<br>
_...wait, why did it not update?_<br>
Phone died, watch followed.

`Pairing now, please wait`<br>
`Type in the six digit code`<br>
`Sorry, incorrect.`

Music sounds muffled.<br>
Why are my neighbors yelling?<br>
My bad. Wrong speakers.

Dubstep pounds next door.<br>
My neighbors love blasting beats.<br>
Just not from my phone.

Insanity is:<br>
Turning it off and on and<br>
expecting to pair.
