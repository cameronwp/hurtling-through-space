_Turns it off and on_<br>
"Ok, it should connect now."<br>
In hell, the devil laughs.

"Music will fill house!"<br>
"Easier than plugging in!"<br>
Those lying bastards.

I see it active.<br>
Flickering, the icon fades.<br>
`Data Transfer Fail`

Sync, my pretty, sync.<br>
I see the video stream.<br>
Oh no. Buffering.

There is connection.<br>
No wait, it has disappeared.<br>
Was it ever there?

Heisenconnection:<br>
The icon shows active sync,<br>
but it is lying.

"Bluetooth enabled,<br>
works with all of your gadgets."<br>
_switches bluetooth off_

_The time zone is wrong..._<br>
_...wait, why did it not update?_<br>
Phone died, watch followed.

`Pairing now, please wait`<br>
`Type in the six digit code`<br>
`Sorry, incorrect.`

Music sounds muffled.<br>
Why are my neighbors yelling?<br>
My bad. Wrong speakers.

Dubstep pounds next door.<br>
My neighbors love blasting beats.<br>
Just not from my phone.

Insanity is:<br>
Turning it off and on and<br>
expecting to pair.

"Bluetooth enabled"<br>
means I need to go buy some<br>
really long cables.

`Syncing...`, the spinner<br>
twirls carefree, unaware of<br>
the hell it creates.

`Cannot find device`<br>
It is six inches away.<br>
*incoherent screams*

And now, a story

Here's how to connect:<br>
Step One: power on, click sync.<br>
Step Two: send a file.

Oh? Did that not work?<br>
Go back to step one. Retry.<br>
Oh? Did that not work?

Let's try this instead:<br>
Hold down the button for ten.<br>
Count it out. One... two...

You wiped the PRAM.<br>
Does it work now? No? Of course,<br>
that was just for fun.

Update your drivers.<br>
I see, they are the latest.<br>
Go back to step one.
