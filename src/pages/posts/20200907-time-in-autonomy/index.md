What comes to mind when you think about artificial intelligence (AI)? Do sentient and maybe murderous robots come to mind? How about Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics? Are you picturing Robin Williams in _Bicentennial Man_? Or what about something more grounded in reality like neural networks?

The "what" and "when" of robotics is paramount. It's not sexy, but if you want a robot to complete tasks, you need it to reason about what needs to be done, in what order, and when those tasks can be completed.
