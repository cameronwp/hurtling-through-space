Big news! Last week I learned that I've been accepted to [MIT's Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/) graduate program! I'll be working on AI/autonomy in the [MERS lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/model-based-embedded-and-robotics-systems-group). More specifically, I'll be researching the problem of multi-agent activity planning and scheduling under time delay. These are the class of algorithms used to help robots and humans coordinate when they're having trouble talking to each other.

This isn't the first time I applied to AeroAstro, or to grad school in general. I received a masters in teaching right after college through the [New Teacher Project](https://tntp.org/). During and after my teaching career right after college, I applied to grad programs in astronomy and educational technology. I was accepted to a few and almost enrolled a few times, but I kept bailing at the last second and deciding that I had better opportunities elsewhere. But this time it's really happening. This opportunity is too good to pass up. Twelve years after a bachelors in physics and astronomy, ten years after a masters in teaching, eight years after I taught myself how to code, and three years after I started [work at NASA](/posts/20190615-getting-into-nasa/), I wake up every morning and pinch myself that this is real.

I applied to AeroAstro because I want my career to define the future of space exploration. It's the ultimate game. Studying astronomy gives you a longer perspective on human events. From the long view, Apollo 11 happened last night. The Wright brothers took flight a few hours before that. We're at the earliest stages of becoming a multi-planetary species. I want to help us realize our destiny in the solar system.

This isn't a career switch. I feel fortunate to be a participating member of the human spaceflight community already. I develop decision support tools for spacewalks at NASA. I work with flight controllers and subject matter experts to build tools to help them make decisions about the what, when, and how of people working in space. This graduate degree represents an opportunity to unite the fields of autonomous exploration and human exploration. We can, and must, use robotic explorers and the lessons learned from endowing them with decision making capabilities to make future human explorers more autonomous and more capable.

It still hasn't quite sunk in. On the one hand, AeroAstro feels like the natural and obvious next step in my career. I bring experience in human spaceflight that's beneficial to MIT. My management at NASA is entirely supportive of my professional development and sees value in me taking the time to engage with and learn from academic communities that only rarely contribute to human exploration. But in retrospect, it seems improbable I, a self-taught programmer with no formal engineering education, has found himself at one of the most prestigious universities pushing the state of the art forward in one of the most demanding fields to ultimately help people _work better in space_.

The rest of this post will tell the whole story of how I went from a high school teacher who graduated college with a B- GPA to an engineer at NASA and an AI researcher at MIT. I don't want anyone to read this and think it's an instruction manual. Unless you're going into a career with predefined paths like law or medicine, it doesn't make sense to try to make the same choices as someone and expect the same results. Rather, I want to shed light on how I think about the future and how that shapes my decision making. This story will take you through all the twists and turns, good choices and bad, that led me to my current career.

<p class="lead-in">Growing up, I could have articulated the same goals about making humans a multi-planetary species without having any idea of how to make them happen. A career after college was a blank space in my mind, in its place was a vague notion that I wanted to make an impact on humanity's story. I grew up idolizing Carl Sagan and Bill Nye. For a while, I wanted to be a science popularizer. I wanted to be an astronomer. I wanted to be an academic. I wanted to write sci-fi and inspire others. What I really wanted was to be an astronaut, but that dream felt too big to pursue.</p>

My career aspirations failed to cement during undergrad at Vanderbilt. I started off as a biology major intending to become an academic in biological sciences, but this was a path I mostly fell into because I took a lot of biology in high school. I considered pursuing a pre-med path, but I never felt enthusiastic about being a doctor. At the beginning of college I was in a work-study program in lab with a zebrafish habitat. As the lowest ranking member of the lab, I spent most of my time performing rote tasks like cleaning tanks and checking pH and salinity levels. This was right around the time that podcasts were becoming really popular. I used to listen to all sorts of science podcasts while I worked, especially anything about space. I kept working in the lab over the summer between my freshman and sophomore years because my family lived just a few minutes away from the Vandy campus in Nashville. That summer, standing between racks of zebrafish, listening to space podcasts and wiping down fish tanks, I had an epiphany that I wanted to switch majors from biology to astronomy. It's the science I loved most after all, and Vandy had an astronomy department. I figured that even if I couldn't be an astronaut and go to space, I would at least be happy as a professional astronomer studying space. A few weeks later I met with the head of the astronomy department and submitted the forms to make the switch.

@@TODO: talk about learning C++ for stellar astrophysics@@

I had my first brush with programming in my senior year. I was studying stellar astrophysics, a mixed undergrad/grad level course about how stars work. Our final project was to write code to simulate the conditions inside a star. The final program would amount to iteratively solving seven equations for properties like heat, pressure, density, rate of fusion reactions, etc, at expanding radii and graphing the result. At the time, I had never written a line of code. I had been doing all the math for my homework assignments in Excel. I initially planned on doing the same for the final project, but it quickly became clear that the complexity of the math and the level of accuracy required would make Excel a bad choice.

About a month before the project was due, I decided to switch gears and use an actual programming language for the project. I knew absolutely nothing about programming languages. I picked C++ just because I thought it had a cool name. I spent the next two weeks going through tutorials online to learn enough C++ to do math in loops and write to CSV files. It took me two more weeks to get my project working, but I did and I got an A. I was really proud of that A. In hindsight, this should have been a sign that I ought to take programming more seriously. Learning C++ on your own is no joke, especially when you are an absolute beginner. I really enjoyed it too. But unfortunately, I wouldn't open a code editor for almost another five years after I turned in that project.

By the time I graduated, I was entirely unprepared to be an academic. I spent so much time in college focused on having as much fun as possible that I missed out on all the obvious preparation for grad school. I barely studied for the GREs. I didn't attend academic conferences or network with professors. I never even asked my advisor what I would need to do to study astronomy in grad school. Sure I did some undergrad research and collected an honor's thesis, but that wasn't enough.

For me, the biggest draw of being an astronomer was that I would have been able to teach. I always loved the idea of teaching college classes and spending my days geeking out over astronomy with students. When the last semester of college rolled around and I realized I wasn't going to grad school right away, I started considering getting experience teaching high school for a few years and then pursuing a graduate degree later. On the advice of my dad and stepmom, both of whom are school administrators and teacher, I enrolled in the New Teacher Project that spring and started attending job fairs for new teachers. I was offered my first full-time job teaching science at a high school in Nashville soon after.

Teaching was the hardest job I've ever had and likely ever will have. I think most teachers would agree with me, especially anyone who went straight into teaching after college. I'll never forget the feeling of closing the classroom door behind me for the first time, all alone, as a 22 year old in front of a class of 9th graders. I was suddenly faced with an immense weight of responsibility. I was no longer a dependent of the educational system, I _was_ the educational system. My attitude and my ability to perform, whether good or bad, now had an impact on hundreds of lives besides my own. I was only just learning how to take care of myself as an adult, yet now I was a parental figure for the hundred some odd students that came through my classroom. It was overwhelming.

Then once I reconciled with the level of maturity and self-discipline required to be a good teacher, the lifestyle of the career started to sink in and the story got worse. The pay and the hours didn't match up, even with summers off. Every morning was an early morning and every night was a late night. My days ended long after the last bell rang. I was stuck on a Sisyphean climb up a mountain of grading. Maybe a handful of times in my teaching career was I lucky enough to leave right after school without creating a backlog of grading and planning I would need to work extra hours later to clear out. There's basically no such thing as overtime for teachers, making most of those hours spent planning for and chaperoning after school events charity[^1].

The first challenge I had as a teacher was classroom management. This goes hand in hand with the notion of finding a teaching personality. I didn't understand my [identity](/posts/20200424-book-review-exhalation/) yet. I still felt like a student.  Was I still a college student, only looking out for myself?  Was teaching going to be my career? Was I taking a detour in my career as a scientist? Or was there another career out there for me? I was all of these things, shifting between them moment to moment.

The first year was the hardest. I had no classroom management skills. It's unrealistic to expect that every single student in every single class is engaged, but I struggled to keep enough order such that the students who were eager to learn even could. It was probably the worst kind of crash course a teacher could have, but by the second year I started to understand what mix of classroom rules and teaching persona I could employ to could create a healthy learning environment. In my fourth year I felt like my classroom was finally running like a well-oiled machine.

Yet, teaching was more rewarding than anything else I have ever done. All the struggle and sleep deprivation were worth it because I got paid to do what I loved - geeking out with students about science. I was explicit that my goal wasn't to turn all of my students into professional scientists (though it has been gratifying to see that a few of them have!) - I just wanted my students to enjoy science! Maybe then science would feel accessible.

I found that my best teaching persona is just being myself. At some point in that first year of teaching, I started opening every class with the [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) (APOD). Students would walk in to my classroom with the lights off and the projector on. The first five or ten minutes would consist of a discussion about some neat astronomy image. No quizzes, no grades. Just a moment to relax and appreciate science. Each year usually started off where I would be the only one talking about each image, but by the second semester, the students learned enough that it was usually a group discussion. A few classes got bored of APOD so they asked for something different. I wound up doing the Animal Picture of the Day a few times (not a website, just me finding weird animals on Wikipedia) and sometimes we just talked about science stories in the news.

Whole class lectures were fine, but I mostly enjoyed the small group moments. I loved picking apart the preconceptions students held about the way the world works in order to help them reassemble a more accurate picture. An intuition about science can make all the difference. Of course the math and equations are the ultimate source of truth, but students need robust mental models to guide their thinking.

Labs and hands on learning were my favorite. Nothing beats getting dirty and collecting numbers. Physics teachers tend to get creative about their labs. I enjoyed taking taking classes outside as much as possible. Football fields are great for running physics experiments. We did egg drops off the stands and speed of sound tests across the field. We went to a playground once to talk about conservation of energy while swinging and climbing on the monkey bars. My students took over the school hallways with catapults and race courses for matchbox cars. I helped design an interdisciplinary science class where the students buried dead chickens to learn about forensic science. We took students to water and sewage treatment plants to learn about water chemistry. We went to an observatory to learn about solar physics. One year we were lucky to have a partnership with a nearby university and our students got to do chemistry in their labs.

In the words of [Ms. Frizzle](https://magicschoolbus.fandom.com/wiki/Professor_Valerie_Frizzle,_PhD), I "got messy" a few times too. And by that I mean I injured myself doing science.

_My teaching idol._

I taught freshman physical science[^2]in my first year of teaching. Students were learning about chemical reactions involving acids and bases, so I wanted to start class with this fun demonstration where you drop a small strip of magnesium in a test tube with hydrochloric acid and it produces hydrogen gas. If you hold another test tube upside down over the reaction (or a [balloon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sitwme77xwA)), you can capture the hydrogen gas and ignite it, producing a neat "whoop!" sound with a quick flame (I took every opportunity to burn things in my chemistry classes).

As this was my first year of teaching, my knowledge of the chemistry supply closet was incomplete so I asked the other chemistry teacher to help me grab the hydrochloric acid. He handed me a glass bottle and neglected to tell me that it was our concentrated 12 M hydrochloric acid, and, being in a hurry because everything was always crazy that first year, I neglected to ask about the concentration.

At high concentrations under STP, hydrochloric acid visibly off-gases enough that it looks like a witches brew. I don't know how I didn't have an alarm in my head blaring "🚨STOP YOU IDIOT THIS IS DANGEROUS🚨" when I poured a few milliliters into a test tube and saw vapors forming. I must have been distracted by my usual classroom management issues. So there I was, standing behind a lab bench in front of a class of freshmen with hydrochloric acid vapors swirling under my face. I had just dropped the magnesium into the test tube when I was seized with an awful burning sensation in my chest. I was drowning in fire. I started heaving and coughing, and of course I dropped the glass test tube, which shattered and sent even more hydrochloric acid vapors into the air. I thought I was dying. I didn't even realize what had happened at first. I turned my head up trying to get away from whatever evil was tearing through my lungs.

My students were understandably alarmed. My classroom management skills were so bad at that point that, to be honest, I had doubts that my students actually cared about me as a human being. I caught enough breath to start sputtering the name of the other chemistry teacher and the word "clinic." To my surprise, the two students closest to the door rushed out and got both of them, the rest backed their desks as far away from me as they could.

A few moments later the front of my classroom was covered in baking soda and I was breathing again. My chest ached. I already sounded hoarse. The nurse said I was probably fine but I should go see a doctor. I gathered all my students back and calmed them down. I was fine, I told them. What had just happened was scary, to be sure, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try the demonstration again. The other chemistry teacher diluted the hydrochloric acid for me, and, eager to not let a small setback like acid burned lungs prevent science from happening, I dissolved some magnesium and blew up the resulting hydrogen gas. I remember my students asking me "why are you trying it again!?" after the whole ordeal, which was a very reasonable question. I told them that mistakes are a great way to learn. You shouldn't let getting something wrong the first time dissuade you from improving and trying again.

As soon as that class was over, a substitute teacher took over for me and I drove straight to my doctor's office.

<p class="dinkus" />

I had my first brush with grad school rejections in my second year of teaching. Life was hard as a new teacher. I still dreamt of life as an astronomer. Nothing had changed about the quality of my applications since I graduated - I knew nothing about the networking and preparation required for grad school. I fired off applications to seven or so schools in a shotgun approach and got rejected from all of them. On a whim, I even sent an application to the [MIT Graduate Program in Science Writing](https://sciwrite.mit.edu/). I still had dreams of becoming the next Carl Sagan. I thought I might have a chance because I had a really high GRE writing score and a lot of experience writing about science for my classes (I had just finished writing a 30-page mini textbook on astronomy for one of my interdisciplinary science classes). Of course, this application also got rejected. This would not be the last rejection letter I'd get from MIT.

This felt like a low point. My big plans for a delayed start as an astronomy grad student completely fell through. I had no idea what to do next. I was starting to love teaching but I still couldn't quite imagine being a teacher for the rest of my life. I wanted new problems to solve and new skills to learn. I started thinking about starting fresh in another career, like maybe the military. But underneath all that frustration and disappointment was a sense of freedom too. I could be whatever I wanted to be. I had no real responsibilities outside work. No strings, no expectations. I could wing it and see where that led. I soon got the chance.

A few months later, between my second and third years of teaching, I realized I had a problem with my physics labs. The school had a small budget for lab equipment and the ordering process took almost a whole school year. I had the luxury of teaching a class without a standardized exam, which meant I had more freedom in the topics we covered. I liked being able to react to student interest. As such, I often felt frustrated that I didn't have the supplies for all the labs I wanted when I wanted them. I had some success getting creative cobbling together labs from the equipment I could find, and sometimes I spent my own money to buy the equipment I needed. What I really needed was time to requisition a closet full of physics equipment. Given it wasn't going to appear overnight, I started to think of alternatives.

A physics simulator came to mind first. Assuming everyone in the class had access to a half-decent computer, virtual labs in a simulator could be cheap, easy, and flexible. [Physlet](https://physlets.org/pp/start.html)-style apps had come in handy for a number of lessons. My favorites came from Colorado University's [PhET](https://phet.colorado.edu/). The physlets had been great but they're all generally made to demonstrate a single concept. I wanted a general purpose simulator. I play a lot of video games. I realized that video game physics engines had potential to be the flexible physics lab tool I needed. It wasn't long until I landed on [_Portal_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)) as my physics lab environment of choice. In _Portal_, players explicitly solve physics puzzles and the game has a general science-y motif.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PRXRFibYpnI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

_A demo of_ Portal.

I needed a proof of concept lesson. I spent the next few days poring over the levels in _Portal_, looking for any environments that could be turned into a kinematics lab. I recognized that the tiles in the game were the key to labs. If you watch the trailer above, you'll see that each room is generally covered in square tiles. Being a standard size and shape, they make for a perfect unit of distance. That opened up a whole range of experiments in kinematics and mechanics.

At the same time, I needed to prove to myself that _Portal's_ [Source Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)) mirrored real-world physics well enough to be useful. The physics didn't need to be perfect, just internally consistent and modeled close enough to real physics to be recognizable. I started running my own experiments. Remember, I had no idea how to code yet. I didn't know how to open the game console and run commands to pull measurements. Rather, I took the physicist approach. I staged experiments in the game, recorded videos, and used physics tracking software to analyze the motion of cubes. I tracked them falling, sliding, and colliding. Lo and behold, the Source Engine modeled realistic-ish physics.

I wrote my first unit of lesson plans about projectile motion. In it, I assumed that every student would have a laptop and a copy of the game to play independently. We had a cart of laptops at the school that met _Portal_'s minimum system requirements, so I wasn't worried about that. But there was the other issue of getting enough copies of _Portal_ for a whole class. I had an idea to ask the Internet for help. Valve Software, the makers of _Portal_, frequently gave out free copies of the game. I bet that a bunch of gamers out there had an extra copy of _Portal_ sitting around and maybe, I hoped, they would be willing to donate them to my class. I shared my lesson on reddit (on [r/portal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portal/comments/j87zu/rportal_this_inner_city_high_school_physics/) and [r/gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/j88ft/rgaming_this_inner_city_high_school_physics/)) and asked for game donations.

My plan worked. I netted about 20 copies of Portal over the next few days. But then, to my surprise, I found this message in my reddit inbox.

> Title: hi from Valve
>
> I just saw your post about using Portal in your physics class, and  we'd love to help you out. We're actually investigating facilitating  exactly this with Portal 2, and we'd love to talk about what you're  doing and what you'd like to do.
>
> Email me at [name redacted]@valvesoftware.com, please, and we'll talk.

I idolized Valve Software. The _Half-Life_ series, the _Portal_ series, _Counter-Strike_, and _Team Fortress 2_ were some of my all-time favorite games. When I got an email from an employee there, it felt like a celebrity wanted to meet me. I couldn't believe it. I emailed them immediately and that started a relationship that would fundamentally alter the arc of my career.

With hindsight, it's easy to ascribe meaning to events like this. Now, ten years later, I can make grandiose claims like "fundamentally alter the arc of my career" because I can clearly trace a series of significant events that originated from this one. But the truth is that at the time I had no idea what this meant or what was going to happen. I was just excited to see where it led. I remember thinking that it could be something big or it could be nothing at all. Either way, this message alone meant I already came out ahead with the _Portal_ experiment.

After a few back-and-forths, I was put in touch with Valve's new person in charge of education, Leslie Redd. The first thing that Leslie told me was that Valve could hook up my class with as many games as we needed, but the catch was they wanted me to use the newly released _Portal 2_ instead. This wasn't really a catch because _Portal 2_ included a an easy-to-use level editor. It would be a huge upgrade to my lessons. I began writing a series of lesson plans that would take advantage of the _Portal 2_ level editor. The level editor would let me reframe my lessons from "find cool physics in _Portal_ to study" to "build physics experiments in _Portal_ and predict the results." If you read through the lessons linked above, you'll see that I had students building contraptions and taking measurements in the game world. This let me task my students with challenges like determining exactly when, how, and by how much the physics in the game diverged from real-life physics (ignoring the fact that portals don't exist).

In these first conversations with Leslie I learned that Valve wanted to support educators but they didn't know how to do it. They were excited to meet teachers like me who might be able to foster learning communities around their games. I learned that they had a new website in the works called Teach with Portals ([teachwithportals.com](http://teachwithportals.com) seems to have been given over to a group called foundry-10 I'm not familiar with, but they're still hosting my [physics lessons](http://www.foundry10.org/programs/games-and-learning/portal-2)!). They wanted teachers to share lesson plans that starred Valve games. I loved it. I was super proud to be a part of the effort to make video games a more mainstream teaching tool.

_My classroom in the fall of 2012. I'm with some of my 11th grade physics students working on their experiments in_ Portal 2.

Valve's grand vision for education needed teacher evangelists with a ton of energy and creativity. I recognized an opportunity. They needed me.

It's hard to know for sure, but I think this was my first time that I took a long view on my choices at hand. I thought Valve should give me a job to be that evangelist full-time.
