Big news! Last week I learned that I've been accepted to MIT's Aeronautics and Astronautics graduate program! My research will focus on AI/autonomy, specifically the problem of multi-agent activity planning and scheduling under time delay. Essentially, I'll be contributing to the class of algorithms used to help robots and humans coordinate when they're having trouble talking to each other.

This isn't the first time I applied to AeroAstro, or to grad school in general for that matter. I got a masters in teaching right after college through the New Teacher Project. After that I applied to astronomy, education, and educational technology programs. I almost enrolled a few times, but I kept bailing at the last second and deciding that I had better opportunities elsewhere. But this time it's really happening. Twelve years after a bachelors in physics and astronomy, ten years after a masters in teaching, eight years after I taught myself how to code, and three years after I started work at NASA, I have to pinch myself that this opportunity is real and this is really happening.

I applied to AeroAstro because I want my career to define the future of space exploration. It's the ultimate game. Studying astronomy gives you a longer perspective on human events. From the long view, Apollo 11 happened last night. The Wright brothers took flight a few hours before that. We're at the earliest stages of becoming a multi-planet species. I want to help us realize our destiny in the solar system.

This isn't a career switch. I feel fortunate to be a participating member of the human spaceflight community already. I develop decision support tools for spacewalks at NASA. I work with flight controllers and subject matter experts to build tools to help them make decisions about the what, when, and how of people working in space. This graduate degree represents an opportunity to unite the fields of autonomous exploration and human exploration. We can, and must, use robotic explorers and the lessons learned from endowing them with decision making capabilities to make future human explorers more autonomous and more capable.

It still hasn't quite sunk in. On the one hand, AeroAstro feels like the natural and obvious next step in my career. I bring experience in human spaceflight that's beneficial to MIT. NASA is entirely supportive of my professional development and sees value in me taking the time to engage with and learn from academic communities that only rarely contribute to human exploration. But in retrospect, it seems improbable I, a self-taught programmer with no formal engineering education, has found himself at one of the most prestigious universities pushing the state of the art forward in one of the most demanding fields to ultimately help people work better _in space_.

The rest of this post will tell the abbreviated story of how I went from a high school teacher who graduated college with a B- GPA from Vanderbilt to an engineer at NASA and an AI researcher at MIT. I don't want anyone to read this and think it's an instruction manual. Unless you're going into a career with predefined paths like law or medicine, it doesn't make any sense to try to make the same choices as someone and expect the same results. Rather, I want to shed light on how I think about the future and how that shapes my decision making.

<p class="lead-in">Growing up, I could have articulated the same goals about making humans a multi-planet species to you without having any idea of how to make them happen. My career was a blank space in my mind. I knew I was going to college, but the next steps were missing. I grew up idolizing Carl Sagan. For a while, I wanted to be a science popularizer. I wanted to be an astronomer. I wanted to be an academic. I wanted to write sci-fi and inspire others.

My career aspirations never clarified in undergrad. I started off as a biology major intending to become an academic in biological sciences, but that was mostly because I took a lot of biology in high school. I considered pursuing a pre-med path, but I was never enthusiastic about being a doctor. At the beginning of college I was I working in lab with a zebrafish habitat on campus. As the lowest ranking member of the lab, I spent most of my time performing rote tasks like cleaning tanks and routine maintenance. This was right around the time that podcasts were becoming really popular. I used to listen to all sorts of science podcasts while I worked, especially anything about space. I kept working in the lab over the summers because my family lived just a few minutes away from the Vandy campus in Nashville. Standing between racks of zebrafish, listening to space podcasts and cleaning fish tanks, I had an epiphany that I wanted to switch majors from biology to astronomy. It's the science I loved most, after all. What I really wanted was to be an astronaut, but I knew that there was basically no chance of that happening. I figured that even if I couldn't go to space, I would at least be happy studying it.

By the time I graduated, I was entirely unprepared to be an academic. I spent so much time in college focused on having as much fun as possible that I missed out on all the obvious preparation for grad school - I never really studied for the GREs, I didn't attend conferences or network with professors, I never even asked my advisor what I would need to do to study astronomy in grad school. Sure I did some research and submitted an honor's thesis, but that wasn't enough.

I went into teaching because I loved science and talking about science. The labs were my favorite part.



Teaching was the hardest job I've ever had and likely ever will have. After four years of teaching, I left feeling exhausted and eager to get back to the role of student. I never felt bored, rather, I wanted to start learning again.



Why "Our Story"? Why not "The Story". It took a lot of people to get here.
