Big news! Last week I learned that I've been accepted to [MIT's Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/) graduate program! I'll be working on AI/autonomy in the [MERS lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/model-based-embedded-and-robotics-systems-group). More specifically, I'll be researching the problem of multi-agent activity planning and scheduling under time delay. These are the class of algorithms used to help robots and humans coordinate when they're having trouble talking to each other.

This isn't the first time I applied to AeroAstro, or to grad school in general. I received a masters in teaching right after college through the [New Teacher Project](https://tntp.org/). During and after my teaching career right after college, I applied to grad programs in astronomy and educational technology. I was accepted to a few and almost enrolled a few times, but I kept bailing at the last second and deciding that I had better opportunities elsewhere. But this time it's really happening. This opportunity is too good to pass up. Twelve years after a bachelors in physics and astronomy, ten years after a masters in teaching, eight years after I taught myself how to code, and three years after I started [work at NASA](/posts/20190615-getting-into-nasa/), I wake up every morning and pinch myself that this is real.

I applied to AeroAstro because I want my career to define the future of space exploration. It's the ultimate game. Studying astronomy gives you a longer perspective on human events. From the long view, Apollo 11 happened last night. The Wright brothers took flight a few hours before that. We're at the earliest stages of becoming a multi-planet species. I want to help us realize our destiny in the solar system.

This isn't a career switch. I feel fortunate to be a participating member of the human spaceflight community already. I develop decision support tools for spacewalks at NASA. I work with flight controllers and subject matter experts to build tools to help them make decisions about the what, when, and how of people working in space. This graduate degree represents an opportunity to unite the fields of autonomous exploration and human exploration. We can, and must, use robotic explorers and the lessons learned from endowing them with decision making capabilities to make future human explorers more autonomous and more capable.

It still hasn't quite sunk in. On the one hand, AeroAstro feels like the natural and obvious next step in my career. I bring experience in human spaceflight that's beneficial to MIT. My management at NASA is entirely supportive of my professional development and sees value in me taking the time to engage with and learn from academic communities that only rarely contribute to human exploration. But in retrospect, it seems improbable I, a self-taught programmer with no formal engineering education, has found himself at one of the most prestigious universities pushing the state of the art forward in one of the most demanding fields to ultimately help people _work better in space_.

The rest of this post will tell the whole story of how I went from a high school teacher who graduated college with a B- GPA to an engineer at NASA and an AI researcher at MIT. I don't want anyone to read this and think it's an instruction manual. Unless you're going into a career with predefined paths like law or medicine, it doesn't make sense to try to make the same choices as someone and expect the same results. Rather, I want to shed light on how I think about the future and how that shapes my decision making.

<p class="lead-in">Growing up, I could have articulated the same goals about making humans a multi-planetary species without having any idea of how to make them happen. A career after college was a blank space in my mind, in its place was a vague notion that I wanted to make an impact on humanity's story. I grew up idolizing Carl Sagan and Bill Nye. For a while, I wanted to be a science popularizer. I wanted to be an astronomer. I wanted to be an academic. I wanted to write sci-fi and inspire others. What I really wanted was to be an astronaut, but that dream felt too big to pursue.</p>

My career aspirations never cemented during undergrad at Vanderbilt. I started off as a biology major intending to become an academic in biological sciences, but this was a path I mostly fell into because I took a lot of biology in high school. I considered pursuing a pre-med path, but I never felt enthusiastic about being a doctor. At the beginning of college I was in a work-study program in lab with a zebrafish habitat. As the lowest ranking member of the lab, I spent most of my time performing rote tasks like cleaning tanks and checking pH and salinity levels. This was right around the time that podcasts were becoming really popular. I used to listen to all sorts of science podcasts while I worked, especially anything about space. I kept working in the lab over the summer between my freshman and sophomore years because my family lived just a few minutes away from the Vandy campus in Nashville. That summer, standing between racks of zebrafish, listening to space podcasts and wiping down fish tanks, I had an epiphany that I wanted to switch majors from biology to astronomy. It's the science I loved most after all, and Vandy had an astronomy department. I figured that even if I couldn't be an astronaut and go to space, I would at least be happy as a professional astronomer studying space. A few weeks later I met with the head of the astronomy department and submitted the forms to make the switch.

By the time I graduated, I was entirely unprepared to be an academic. I spent so much time in college focused on having as much fun as possible that I missed out on all the obvious preparation for grad school. I barely studied for the GREs. I didn't attend academic conferences or network with professors. I never even asked my advisor what I would need to do to study astronomy in grad school. Sure I did some undergrad research and collected an honor's thesis, but that wasn't enough.

For me, the biggest draw of being an astronomer was that I would have been able to teach. I always loved the idea of teaching college classes and spending my days geeking out over astronomy with students. When the last semester of college rolled around and I realized I wasn't going to grad school right away, I started considering getting experience teaching high school for a few years and then pursuing a graduate degree later. On the advice of my dad and stepmom, both of whom are school administrators and teacher, I enrolled in the New Teacher Project that spring and started attending job fairs for new teachers. I was offered my first full-time job teaching science at a high school in Nashville soon after.

Teaching was the hardest job I've ever had and likely ever will have. I think most teachers would agree with me, especially anyone who went straight into teaching after college. I'll never forget the feeling of closing the classroom door behind me for the first time, all alone, as a 22 year old in front of a class of 9th graders. I was suddenly faced with an immense weight of responsibility. I was no longer a dependent of the educational system, I _was_ the educational system. My attitude and my ability to perform, whether good or bad, now had an impact on hundreds of lives besides my own. I was only just learning how to take care of myself as an adult, yet now I was a parental figure for the hundred some odd students that came through my classroom. It was overwhelming.

Then once I reconciled with the level of maturity and self-discipline required to be a good teacher, the lifestyle of the career started to sink in and the story got worse. The pay and the hours didn't match up, even with summers off. Every morning was an early morning and every night was a late night. My days ended long after the last bell rang. I was stuck on a Sisyphean climb up a mountain of grading. Maybe a handful of times in my teaching career was I lucky enough to leave right after school without creating a backlog of grading and planning I would need to work extra hours later to clear out. There's basically no such thing as overtime for teachers, making most of those hours spent planning for and chaperoning after school events charity[^1].

The first challenge I had as a teacher was classroom management. This goes hand in hand with the notion of finding a teaching personality. I didn't understand my [identity](/posts/20200424-book-review-exhalation/) yet. I still felt like a student.  Was I still a college student, only looking out for myself?  Was teaching going to be my career? Was I taking a detour in my career as a scientist? Or was there another career out there for me? I was all of these things, shifting between them moment to moment.

The first year was the hardest. I had no classroom management skills. It's unrealistic to expect that every single student in every single class is engaged, but I struggled to keep enough order such that the students who were eager to learn even could. It was probably the worst kind of crash course a teacher could have, but by the second year I started to understand what mix of classroom rules and teaching persona I could employ to could create a healthy learning environment. In my fourth year I felt like my classroom was finally running like a well-oiled machine.

Yet, teaching was more rewarding than anything else I have ever done. All the struggle and sleep deprivation were worth it because I got paid to do what I loved - geeking out with students about science. I was explicit that my goal wasn't to turn all of my students into professional scientists (though it has been gratifying to see that a few of them have!) - I just wanted my students to enjoy science! Maybe then science would feel accessible.

I found that my best teaching persona is just being myself. At some point in that first year of teaching, I started opening every class with the [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) (APOD). Students would walk in to my classroom with the lights off and the projector on. The first five or ten minutes would consist of a discussion about some neat astronomy image. No quizzes, no grades. Just a moment to relax and appreciate science. Each year usually started off where I would be the only one talking about each image, but by the second semester, the students learned enough that it was usually a group discussion. A few classes got bored of APOD so they asked for something different. I wound up doing the Animal Picture of the Day a few times (not a website, just me finding weird animals on Wikipedia) and sometimes we just talked about science stories in the news.

Whole class lectures were fine, but I mostly enjoyed the small group moments. I loved picking apart the preconceptions students held about the way the world works in order to help them reassemble a more accurate picture. An intuition about science can make all the difference. Of course the math and equations are the ultimate source of truth, but students need robust mental models to guide their thinking.

Labs and hands on learning were my favorite. Nothing beats getting dirty and collecting numbers. Physics teachers tend to get creative about their labs. I enjoyed taking taking classes outside as much as possible. Football fields are great for running physics experiments. We did egg drops off the stands and speed of sound tests across the field. We went to a playground once to talk about conservation of energy while swinging and climbing on the monkey bars. My students took over the school hallways with catapults and race courses for matchbox cars. I helped design an interdisciplinary science class where the students buried dead chickens to learn about forensic science. We took students to water and sewage treatment plants to learn about water chemistry. We went to an observatory to learn about solar physics. One year we were lucky to have a partnership with a nearby university and our students got to do chemistry in their labs.

In the words of [Ms. Frizzle](https://magicschoolbus.fandom.com/wiki/Professor_Valerie_Frizzle,_PhD), I "got messy" a few times too. And by that I mean I injured myself doing science.

_My teaching idol._

I taught freshman physical science[^2]in my first year of teaching. Students were learning about chemical reactions involving acids and bases, so I wanted to start class with this fun demonstration where you drop a small strip of magnesium in a test tube with hydrochloric acid and it produces hydrogen gas. If you hold another test tube upside down over the reaction (or a [balloon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sitwme77xwA)), you can capture the hydrogen gas and ignite it, producing a neat "whoop!" sound with a quick flame (I took every opportunity to burn things in my chemistry classes).

As this was my first year of teaching, my knowledge of the chemistry supply closet was incomplete so I asked the other chemistry teacher to help me grab the hydrochloric acid. He handed me a glass bottle and neglected to tell me that it was our concentrated 12 M hydrochloric acid, and, being in a hurry because everything was always crazy that first year, I neglected to ask about the concentration.

At high concentrations under STP, hydrochloric acid visibly off-gases enough that it looks like a witches brew. I don't know how I didn't have an alarm in my head blaring "🚨STOP YOU IDIOT THIS IS DANGEROUS🚨" when I poured a few milliliters into a test tube and saw vapors forming. I must have been distracted by my usual classroom management issues. So there I was, standing behind a lab bench in front of a class of freshmen with hydrochloric acid vapors swirling under my face. I had just dropped the magnesium into the test tube when I was seized with an awful burning sensation in my chest. I was drowning in fire. I started heaving and coughing, and of course I dropped the glass test tube, which shattered and sent even more hydrochloric acid vapors into the air. I thought I was dying. I didn't even realize what had happened at first. I turned my head up trying to get away from whatever evil was tearing through my lungs.

My students were understandably alarmed. To be honest, my classroom management skills were so bad at that point that I had doubts that my students actually cared about me as a human being. I caught enough breath to start sputtering the name of the other chemistry teacher and the word "clinic." To my surprise, two students rushed out and got both of them, the rest backed their desks as far away from me as they could.

A few moments later, the front of my classroom was covered in baking soda and I was breathing again. My chest ached. I already sounded hoarse. The nurse said I was probably fine but I should go see a doctor. I gathered all my students back and calmed them down. I was fine, I told them. What had just happened was scary, to be sure, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try the demonstration again. The other chemistry teacher diluted the hydrochloric acid for me, and, eager to not let a small setback like acid burned lungs prevent science from happening, I dissolved some magnesium and blew up the resulting hydrogen gas. I remember my students asking me "why are you trying it again!?" after the whole ordeal, which was a very reasonable question. I told them that mistakes are a great way to learn. You shouldn't let getting something wrong the first time dissuade you from improving and trying again.

As soon as that class was over, a substitute teacher took over for me and I drove straight to my doctor's office.

Between my second and third years of teaching, I realized I had a problem with my physics labs. The main issue was that the school had a small budget for lab equipment and the ordering process took almost a whole school year. I had the luxury of teaching a class without a standardized exam, which meant I had more freedom in the topics we covered. I liked being able to react to student interest. I wanted to modify my labs and lessons to meet their curiosity @@awk@@. As such, I often felt frustrated that I didn't have the supplies for all the labs I wanted. I had some success getting creative cobbling together labs from the equipment I could find, or just spending my own money to buy the equipment I needed. But I wanted a lab solution that was a lot more flexible. I had an immediate need for a fully stocked closet of physics lab equipment, but given that wasn't going to happen anytime soon, I started to think of alternatives.

A physics simulator came to mind first. [Physlet](https://physlets.org/pp/start.html)-style interactions had come in handy, my favorite being Colorado University's [PhET](https://phet.colorado.edu/). Assuming everyone in the class has access to a half-decent computer, virtual labs in a simulator could be cheap, easy, and flexible. The physlets had been great but they're all generally made to demonstrate a single concept. I wanted a general purpose simulator. I play a lot of video games and quickly realized that game engines had potential to be the flexible physics lab tool I needed.

After four years of teaching, I left feeling exhausted and eager to get back to the role of student. I never felt bored, rather, I wanted to start learning again.
