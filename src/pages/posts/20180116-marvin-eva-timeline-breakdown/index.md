_This is part 2 of the Marvin series. Here’s part 1._

Picture yourself in a meeting room at NASA with scientists, engineers, and astronauts in the early 1960s. You’re having a hard time breathing because everyone smoked everywhere and good ventilation wasn’t really a priority back then. You’re discussing plans to visit the Moon in the next decade. You’re talking about rocket thrust, fuel, cost, and engineering timelines. You’re talking about the controls of the lander. You’re talking about life support and staying alive in a vacuum. You’re talking about public appearances and drumming up support and beating the Russians who just put Yuri Gagarin in space. And pertinently to this series of articles, the topic of what to _do_ on the Moon comes up and what the scientists want collected.

This is where our story picks up - planning EVAs. For the first and only time in our history, we had to decide what we wanted to do on the Moon. These were our first steps on a different world, wholly unconnected from everything humans had ever known. How do you balance all of the exploration against safety concerns and engineering limits? The surface area of the Moon is [slightly less than Asia](https://www.universetoday.com/20489/moon-compared-to-earth/), after all. What do you want to see? How do you decide what science to support and what science will have to wait a few years (or a century?) for us to revisit?
