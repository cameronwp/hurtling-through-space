_This is part 2 of the Marvin series. Here’s part 1._

Picture yourself in a meeting room at NASA with scientists, engineers, flight controllers, and astronauts in the early 1960s. It's easy to ignore that your eyes are watering and you can't breathe from all the cigarette smoke because you’re talking about visiting the Moon in the next decade. You’re talking about rocket thrust, fuel, cost, and engineering timelines. You’re talking about the controls of the lander. You’re talking about life support and staying alive in a vacuum. You’re talking about public appearances and drumming up support and beating the Russians who just put Yuri Gagarin in space. And pertinently to this series of articles, the topic of what to _do_ on the Moon comes up and what the scientists want collected.

This is where our story picks up - planning EVAs. Perfect timing too because this paper just came out on EVA timelines.<><>footnote cite<><>

For the first and only time in our history, we had to decide what we wanted to do on the Moon. These were our first steps on a different world, wholly unconnected from everything humans had ever known. How do you balance all of the exploration against safety concerns and engineering limits? The surface area of the Moon is [slightly less than Asia](https://www.universetoday.com/20489/moon-compared-to-earth/) after all. What do you want to see? How do you decide what science to support and what science will have to wait a few years (or a century?) for us to revisit?

I wonder if EVA timeline planning got overlooked in those meetings. The answer, is no. 13 hours of training to every hour of EVA. Now it's 3 to 1. <><>cite new paper<><>

"What will we do once we get there?"

"Get rocks."

"Great."

Of course, this is wrong. This is a big deal, especially to the geologists. I've been in meetings where we have a 20 minute discussion about the different ways to strike a rock with a hammer and what they're called. There were factions within the geologists, notably by nationality. At one point, a Brit tossed out the term "cheeky knock," which instantly became canon and I'm sure has since been published in geology papers about BASALT.

The human element in an EVA makes it difficult to plan. Every moment is at the whim of what samples the fates have left nearby and what the crew notice and ultimately think of what they find. As a result, there's a _laissez faire_ attitude with exploration EVAs. Each one is going to be different. Each one will present new challenges and  reasons for delays. Each delay will be different. Every timeline will look different and the time ahead t/ time behind will look different.

* brief intro
* review of the paper
	- note challenge of matching as-planned and actual timelines. crew often called out completion of tasks in bulk rather than instantly when done
* deconstruct a timeline (apollo / iss ?)
	- activity, task, subtask, procedure
* interlude: telemetry in Mission Control (shot that Matthew took?)
* show timeline of GT experiment
* break down how the GT experiment worked
	- the EV actors
	- the IV
	- what's on the screen, what's on paper
	- the scenario the IV crew were given
		+ how we tweaked it
* some high level results re: timing

"In particular, the Apollo program pioneered
the concept of incorporating a team of scientists to support real-time and strategic
decision making regarding human surface operations" p5

section 1.2 - all about structure of timelines

"An EVA timeline is
a compiled, sequenced set of tasks at various levels of description which contains
the geospatial and temporal information associated with all tasks to be performed" p8

p15, 16 - start description of timeline structure
p18 - measuring tasks. is a task duration really the diff between its start time and the next's? (probably good to hint at Marvin's step duration definition (no dead time))
